## Project Overview
OnlineShope, a leading online retail business, is experiencing reduced customer engagement and declining conversion rates despite significant investments in marketing campaigns. This project leverages Python, SQL, and Power BI to analyze marketing strategies, identify key areas for improvement, and provide actionable insights to boost customer engagement and optimize conversion rates.


## Features
- **Customer Engagement Analysis**: Evaluate interaction levels with marketing content to uncover trends and opportunities.
- **Conversion Funnel Optimization**: Identify factors impacting conversion rates and stages where visitors drop off.
- **Customer Feedback Insights**: Extract and analyze common themes from reviews to guide product and service improvements.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Power BI visualizations for decision-making with detailed insights into KPIs.

## Tools and Technologies
### Python
Python is used for data analysis, preprocessing, and advanced sentiment analysis. With libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation, `mysql-connector-python` for database connectivity, and `nltk`'s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer for sentiment analysis, Python provides a powerful environment for working with data. We use it to clean, analyze, and derive insights from customer engagement data and reviews.

### Power BI
Power BI is used for creating interactive and insightful visualizations. With its user-friendly interface, Power BI allows us to build dynamic dashboards that provide real-time data insights. These dashboards help us visualize KPIs such as conversion rates, customer engagement, and feedback scores, aiding in decision-making and business optimization.

### DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
DAX is used within Power BI to create custom calculations, aggregations, and complex metrics for deeper data insights. It allows us to enhance our visualizations by adding sophisticated calculations such as year-over-year growth, weighted averages, and dynamic filtering, enabling more advanced analysis of customer engagement and conversion rates.

### SQL Workbench
SQL Workbench is used to query and clean data stored in databases. SQL scripts are executed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, ensuring that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data being analyzed is accurate and well-structured.

### Additional Tools
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks, especially sentiment analysis of customer reviews.
- **MySQL**: For managing and querying customer engagement and feedback data stored in relational databases.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preparation before analysis.

These technologies work together seamlessly to provide comprehensive insights that can drive business decisions and improve customer engagement and conversion rates.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of website visitors who complete purchases.
- **Customer Engagement Rate**: Interaction levels with marketing content (clicks, likes, comments).
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Average spend per customer per transaction.
- **Customer Feedback Score**: Average ratings from customer reviews.
